,FRACTURE,"A top secret research facility split apart by a failed radianite experiment. With
defender options as divided as the map, the choice is yours: meet the attackers
on their own turf or batten down the hatches to weather the assault.",img/maps/fracture.jpeg
,BREEZE,"Take in the sights of historic ruins or seaside caves on this tropical paradise.
But bring some cover. You'll need them for the wide open spaces and long
range engagements. Watch your flanks and this will be a Breeze.",img/maps/breeze.jpeg
,ICEBOX,"Your next battleground is a secret Kingdom excavation site overtaken by the
arctic. The two plant sites protected by snow and metal require some horizontal
finesse. Take advantage of the ziplines and they’ll never see you coming.",img/maps/icebox.jpeg
,BIND,"Two sites. No middle. Gotta pick left or right. What’s it going to be then? Both
offer direct paths for attackers and a pair of one-way teleporters make it easier
to flank.",img/maps/bind.jpeg
,HAVEN,"Beneath a forgotten monastery, a clamour emerges from rival Agents clashing
to control three sites. There’s more territory to control, but defenders can use
the extra real estate for aggressive pushes.",img/maps/haven.jpeg
,SPLIT,"If you want to go far, you’ll have to go up. A pair of sites split by an elevated
center allows for rapid movement using two rope ascenders. Each site is built
with a looming tower vital for control. Remember to watch above before it all
blows sky-high.",img/maps/split.jpeg
,ASCENT,"An open playground for small wars of position and attrition divide two sites on
Ascent. Each site can be fortified by irreversible bomb doors; once they’re
down, you’ll have to destroy them or find another way. Yield as little territory
as possible.",img/maps/ascent.jpeg
